# Current tasks list

[ ] Gameplay camera system -- one place to control camera (moving it around, zooming etc), layer over renderer

This should also allow for freecam / debug camera, etc.

We should also solve the jumping/jitter issue with movement.

Cool feature idea -- if more than 1 Entity is signed up to camera system, try to fit all of them inside the camera view. Should be easy since its ortohographic.
