# Pitch

Game about defending your house from zombies.
Buy weapons, build traps and survive as long as you can.

Procedurally generated homes.
Clever traps mechanics.
Rewarding gameplay.

No overthinking -- money from zombies. Buy traps and guns using money. It
does not need to be realistic in order to be fun!

# Prototype

- 2D
- Waves of zombies
- Buying new weapons after every wave
- $$$ from zombies
- house and yard to walk around
- audiovisual effects
- simple trap building, not restricted to a grid
- basic menu

Traps can be built during the preparation phase (60s before the wave) and
during the wave.

Waves could have constant time, maybe 2mins? Then the wave remains until last zombie is dead.

# Trap ideas

Funny traps, like car on a string, or mouse-like trap...

# Zombie ideas

Classic ones? slow, fast, exploding kamikaze, big mutants?
inspo from plants vs zombies (jumping over fence etc)
Funny zombies like jumping ones, runners, zombie that looks like
a tank

# Full version

  with friends?
